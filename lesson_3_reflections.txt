When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To share all the changes with other participants, as well as the user can
    work on different locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes I want to pull an older version of the git commit, and I want
    to have the total control of what I will work on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is to copy a repository from Github to Github. Clones is to copy a repository
    from anywhere to a local place. Branch is to make a different version of the file
    within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Then it will be easier to work since I will know what happened on the remote repository
    as well.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I will just copy and paste all the files each time we make a change. Git hub
    will be easier if there are multiple people or multiple projects.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
